# Babies_first_game
My first attempt at making a complete game from code.

Im doing all of this on git hub to get familiar with the site and process. 
I dont expect any feedback. But will appreciate any that comes my way.

The game is tic tac toe and so far the inputs for the player will be the grid coordinates.

later i want to experiment with a GUI but for now i bearly know how to use a dictionary.
